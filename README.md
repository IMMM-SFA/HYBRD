# HYBRD - HYBrid Regional Downscaling Model

## Purpose
The HYBRD model is a high-resolution urban land downscaling model that adapts the sequential two-step process used by other urban growth prediction models (UGPMs) into a three-step procedure, inclusive of statistical models and cellular automata-based algorithms.  The hybrid approach refers to the sequence of three models, the first two statistical models governing demand for total urban land and controlling transitions in urban intensity, or alternatively, urban morphology classes, and the cellular automata model governing the downscaled portion through urban land extensification.  HYBRD also aims to evaluate alternative zoning policies to span the gap between global socioeconomic pressures and more localized policy controls. As a test case, HYBRD was applied to Los Angeles, California to examine varied urban morphology simulations among SSP scenarios.

## Code reference
References for each minted software release for all code involved.  

These are generated by Zenodo automatically when conducting a release when Zenodo has been linked to your GitHub repository. The Zenodo references are built by setting the author order in order of contribution to the code using the author's GitHub username.  This citation can, and likely should, be edited without altering the DOI.

If you have modified a codebase that is outside of a formal release, and the modifications are not planned on being merged back into a version, fork the parent repository and add a `.<shortname>` to the version number of the parent and construct your own name.  For example, `v1.2.5.hydro`.
